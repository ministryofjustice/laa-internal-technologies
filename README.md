# LAA Recommended Technologies

The purpose of this repo is to allow members of the LAA Digital development community to crowd-source guidance on the use of various technologies within the department.

Below are links to different categories of technology. Each category contains a list of relevant technology choices, each with a brief description of what it is and a recommendation for its use.

Recommendations fall into three categories:

* `Recommended` means you can use it.

* `Limited` use means that there’s probably some reason why it wouldn’t ideally be used (for example costs, licensing constraints, or maybe better alternatives exist) but it can be used with sufficient justification.

* `Do not use` means it shouldn’t be used within LAA Digital.

Where technologies may be a matter of personal taster (for example IDEs) there might not be a recommendation.

## How to make changes

If you feel guidance is missing, incomplete or incorrect please:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-recommended-technologies/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-recommended-technologies/discussions) to highlight the problem and allow the community to suggest and discuss potential changes.

or

2. Open a pull request suggesting changes to the guidance. Please try to write good commit and pull request messages to help the community understand the changes.

## Guidelines

* Feel free to add new categories of technology, add new options within categories, or suggest changes to existing recommendations.

* Discussion is good. If you have views on a colleague’s pull request please comment on it in GitHub (rather than in person or through another medium). This will allow the rest of the community to openly discuss the changes.

* Where there is discussion please try to achieve some degree of consensus before merging changes to the main branch.
