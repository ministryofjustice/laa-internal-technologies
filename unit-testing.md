# Unit Testing

This page lists unit testing frameworks that are recommended for use with the main programming languages used in LAA Digital.

## Ruby

| Name | Status | Usecase  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|
| RSpec | Recommended | Default choice | Testing framework for Ruby/Ruby on Rails. Tests include clear statements explaining how the application is expected to behave. RSpec is currently the default choice and is used for all existing applications within the department. https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails |
| Minitest | Limited use |  | Developers should aim to use RSpec for consistency with existing applications, however Minitest is a valid alternative and can be used given reasonable justification https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest |

## Python

| Name | Status | Usecase  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  UnitTest | Recommended |  | Inbuilt unit testing framework |
|  PyTest | TBC |  | The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries https://pypi.org/project/pytest/ |
